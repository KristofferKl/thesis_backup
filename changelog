changed .xml file entry from warehouse_..._mongo to warehouse_..._sqlite

sjekk: motoros 2_interface versjonen, evt motoros_versjonen....

changing all instances of "warehouse_ros_mongo" to warehouse_ros_sqlite

undoing: changing all instances of "warehouse_ros_mongo" to warehouse_ros_sqlite
note: this did not fix the problem with RViz having both sqlite and mongo listed....

build: ~/ws_master$ colcon build   --mixin release   --packages-up-to motoros2_client_interface_dependencies
this was used to build parts of the workspace, not necesary anymore

When activating the servos for Motoros: the first time they are activated (in each session) the teach-pendant/start cell button were used, some more testing is needed to say with certainty.

disabled dependencies for modern robotics in src/jacobian_generator/package.xml
disabled dependencies for moveit_core/trajectory_processing in src/moveit_group_planner/package.xml

TODO: attempting to convert from ros_warehouse_mongo to ros_warehouse_sqlite NOTE: not completed, change this when/if it is done
NOTE: use "rosdep install --skip-keys=warehouse_ros_mongo  --from-paths src --ignore-src" to run "rosdep install" despite mongo not being supported

Edited the line in /home/zivid/ws_master/src/moveit2/moveit_configs_utils/moveit_configs_utils/launches.py:
	from this:
            "capabilities",
            default_value=moveit_config.move_group_capabilities["capabilities"],
        to this:
            "capabilities",
            default_value=moveit_config.move_group_capabilities,
seems to have solved the KeyError "capabilities" problem

the problem with joint_states not being published is realted to the YRC1000, and according to motoros2 github it is occuring due to unknown reasons because of the group-combination


Solution:::::
	created new node that combines all four joint-trajectories and publishes them on /joint_states
	
	
NOTE: group 4 (the workbench) is defined with negative velues all rotations are on oposite directions compared to what is visualized in RViz !!!

Problem with waypoint_publisher: when our new node group_topic_combiner_node is publishing, waypoint_publisher rarely works


Removed workpiece by editing the files: /home/zivid/ws_master/src/motoman/motoman_gp25sys_support/urdf/gp25sys.urdf 
and /home/zivid/ws_master/src/motoman/motoman_gp25sys_support/urdf/gp25sys.xacro 
and /home/zivid/ws_master/src/robco/config/motoman_gp25sys.srdf
to not have any more dependencies on the workpiece.

in the urdf and xacro the workpiece link and workpiece joint were commented out
In the srdf all collision-checks with the workpiece were commented out
